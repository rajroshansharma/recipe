      After frying the omelette  the colour of the omelette should be yellow or golden .it looks very
good and smell is awsome.you should add some of the chilli flakes for make the dish more attractive 
and spicy.you can eat 3 or 4 eggs .as per your wish.you should eat it as soon as posssible
<br><br>These cute little<a href ="https://pinchmegood.com/veggie-egg-rolls-with-tofu/">Veggie Egg Rolls</a> with tofu are super
crispy but baked and not fried so they are
much better for you so you can eat way more and not feel guilty.  LOVE IT!
All veggies that go well together and just really make these egg rolls so flavorful. You could even skip 
the egg roll wrappers and turn this recipe into an ‚Äúegg roll in a bowl‚Äù for a fun spin on a buddha
bowl. Similar to the Easy Vegetarian Pad Thai .
