  <p>Gulliver's Travels, or Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four 
    Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver,First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships is
    a prose  of 1726 by the Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, 
    satirising both human nature and the "travellers' tales" literary subgenre. It
    is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. Swift
    claimed that he wrote Gulliver's Travels "to vex the world rather than divert it".
    The book was an immediate success. The English dramatist John Gay remarked "It is
    universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery. In 2015, Robert
    McCrum released his selection list of 100 best novels of all time in which Gulliver's 
    Travels is listed as a satirical masterpiece</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>The book is written in the first person from the point of view of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemuel_Gulliver">Lemuel Gulliver</a>, a surgeon and sea captain who 
    visits remote regions of the world, and it describes four adventures. In the first one, Gulliver is the only survivor
    of a shipwreck, and he swims to Lilliput, where he is tied up by people who are less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall. He is
    then taken to the capital city and eventually released. The Lilliputians indulge in ridiculous customs and petty 
    debates. Political affiliations, for example, are divided between men who wear high-heeled shoes (symbolic of the
    English Tories) and those who wear low ones (representing the English Whigs), and court positions are filled by those
    who are best at rope dancing.<br> Gulliver is asked to help defend Lilliput against the empire of Blefuscu, with which
    Lilliput is at war over which end of an egg should be broken, this being a matter of religious doctrine. Gulliver
    captures Blefuscu’s naval fleet, thus preventing an invasion, but declines to assist the emperor of Lilliput in
    conquering Blefuscu. Later Gulliver extinguishes a fire in the royal palace by urinating on it. Eventually he falls out
    of favour and is sentenced to be blinded and starved. He flees to Blefuscu, where he finds a normal-size boat and is
    thus able to return to England.
   Gulliver’s second voyage takes him to Brobdingnag, inhabited by a race of giants. A farm worker finds Gulliver and
    delivers him to the farm owner. The farmer begins exhibiting Gulliver for money, and the farmer’s young daughter,
    Glumdalclitch, takes care of him. <br>One day the queen orders the farmer to bring Gulliver to her, and she purchases 
    Gulliver. He becomes a favourite at court, though the king reacts with contempt when Gulliver recounts the splendid 
    achievements of his own civilization. The king responds to Gulliver’s description of the government and history of
    England by concluding that the English must be a race of “odious vermin.” Gulliver offers to make gunpowder and cannon
    for the king, but the king is horrified by the thought of such weaponry. Eventually Gulliver is picked up by an eagle
    and then rescued at sea by people of his own size.</p>
